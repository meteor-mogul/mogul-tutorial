# meteor-mogul tutorial

Welcome to the meteor-mogul tutorial.

In this tutorial, you create a simple app to manage a 'to do' list and collaborate with others on those tasks. By the end, you should have a basic understanding of meteor-mogul.

## Getting Started (Preliminaries)

If you haven't already, install the following:

 - [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/)
 - [git](https://git-scm.com/)
 - A programming editor. (I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)\).

Optionally, you might want to install:

 - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which makes it easier to manage source code on GitHub.

Finally, you'll also need to set up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account for yourself.
