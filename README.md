Build a simple meteor app to manage a task list using VueJS as the view layer.

In this tutorial, you create a simple app to manage a 'to do' list and collaborate with others on those tasks. By the end, you should have a basic understanding of meteor-mogul.

## View Layers

The official meteor tutorial is available in three view layers:

* Blaze
* React
* Angular

VueJS is a fourth view layer.  Like Blaze, it is easy to understand and pick up.  But unlike Blaze, there is a robust community outside of meteor that is using VueJS.

By doing this tutorial, you'll not only learn how to use meteor, but you'll also learn a little bit about VueJS.  In addition, you'll learn a little Bootstrap, a CSS framework.

## CSS Frameworks

 There are three major CSS frameworks to help you style your apps:

 * Bootstrap
 * Foundation
 * Materialize

 In this tutorial you'll use Bootstrap, a stable framework that is easy to learn.  Materialize is still in beta.  Foundation is powerful but more difficult to learn.

## Getting Started

The master branch is the starting point.  Each lesson is a separate branch.

You can run it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/meteor-mogul/mogul-tutorial.git
$ cd mogul-tutorial
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor
```
